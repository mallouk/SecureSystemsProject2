1) First run the conf_ca script to generate the certs for the CA
./conf_ca

2) Next run the conf_server script to generate the certs for the server
./conf_server

3) Now run the conf_client script with a client name argument
./conf_client mototito

4) Run the transfer script to push these certs to the nginx system files, and set up the nginx server and ssl connections (hopefully it works).
