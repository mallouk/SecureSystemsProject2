1) Run the install script in this directory to set up the environment and install nginx, etc.

2) First run the conf_ca script to generate the certs for the CA
./conf_ca

3) Next run the conf_server script to generate the certs for the server
./conf_server

4) Now run the conf_client script with a client name argument
./conf_client mototito

5) Run the transfer script to push these certs to the nginx system files, and set up the nginx server and ssl connections (hopefully it works).
