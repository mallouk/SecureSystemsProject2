1) Run the install script in this directory to set up the environment and install nginx, etc.

2) Run the transfer script in the proj2-ss folder to move all of the certificates to the right locations.

3) Since the code and all respective clients are set up already, just the run_test_cases script to step through the system for the client/server communication.
   Open terminal and run the server.py script:
   python server.py
   The server may prompt you for a PEM password. This was used when generating the certs.
   The password is "pass"
   

4) Open a second terminal and run the run_test cases bash script
   ./run_test_cases

Make sure that a server.py script is running in a seperate terminal!!!

Certificate Creations Instructions (Not Needed if they already Exist)
2) First run the conf_ca script to generate the certs for the CA
./conf_ca

3) Next run the conf_server script to generate the certs for the server
./conf_server

4) Now run the conf_client script with a client name argument
./conf_client [name]

5) Run the transfer script to push these certs to the nginx system files, and set up the nginx server and ssl connections (hopefully it works).
