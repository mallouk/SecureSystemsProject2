1) Run the install script in this directory to set up the environment and install nginx, etc.

2) First run the conf_ca script to generate the certs for the CA
./conf_ca

3) Next run the conf_server script to generate the certs for the server
./conf_server

4) Now run the conf_client script with a client name argument
./conf_client mototito

5) Run the transfer script to push these certs to the nginx system files, and set up the nginx server and ssl connections (hopefully it works).





-----------------------------------------------

Since the code and all respective clients are set up already, just the run_test_cases script to step through the system for the client/server communication.
1) Open terminal and run the server.py script:
   python server.py
   The server may prompt you for a PEM password. This was used when generating the certs.
   The password is "pass"
   

2) Open a second terminal and run the run_test cases bash script
   ./run_test_cases

Make sure that a server.py script is running in a seperate terminal!!!
